Fairly frequently, you might run into situations when you need to spend company money. 

<Note>
Please spend money in a way that you think is in the best interest of the company.

# Trivial expenses

We don't want you to be slowed down because you're waiting for an approval to purchase some SaaS. For trivial expenses – **Just do it**.

This means expenses that are: 
1. Non-recurring AND less than $75/month in total.
2. Recurring AND less than $20/month. 

## Saving receipts

Make sure you keep copies for all receipts. If you expense something on a company card and cannot provide a receipt, this may be deducted from your pay.

You should default to using your company card in all cases - it has no transaction fees. If using your personal card is unavoidable, please reach out to Maidul to get it reimbursed manually.


# Equipment

Infisical is a remote first company so we understand the importance of having a comfortable work setup. To support this, we provide allowances for essential office equipment.

### Desk & Chair

Most people already have a comfortable desk and chair, but if you need an upgrade, Infisical offers the following allowances. 
While we're not yet able to provide the latest and greatest, we strive to be reasonable given the stage of our company.

**Desk**: $150 USD

**Chair**: $150 USD

### Laptop
- Each team member will get a company issues Macbook Pro before they start their first day.

### Headphones
- If you require noise-cancelling headphones for your work environment, discuss your needs with your manager.


### Important Notes

1. All equipment purchased using company allowances remains the property of Infisical.
2. Keep all receipts for equipment purchases and submit them for reimbursement.
3. If you leave Infisical, you may be required to return company-owned equipment.

Please note that Infisical is unable to offer a split payment option where the company pays half and the employee pays half for equipment exceeding the allowance. 
This is due to the absence of a formal HR department, which would make such arrangements logistically challenging to manage and track. 
If you require equipment that exceeds the provided allowance, please discuss alternative options with your manager.

For any questions or special requirements, please reach out to your direct supervisor or the operations team.


## Brex

We use Brex as our primary credit card provider. Don't have a company card yet? Reach out to Maidul.
