Fairly frequently, you might run into situations when you need to spend company money. 

**Please spend money in a way that you think is in the best interest of the company.**

## Trivial expenses

We don't want you to be slowed down because you're waiting for an approval to purchase some SaaS. For trivial expenses – **Just do it**.

This means expenses that are: 
1. Non-recurring AND less than $75/month in total.
2. Recurring AND less than $20/month. 

## Saving receipts

Make sure you keep copies for all receipts. If you expense something on a company card and cannot provide a receipt, this may be deducted from your pay.

You should default to using your company card in all cases - it has no transaction fees. If using your personal card is unavoidable, please reach out to Maidul to get it reimbursed manually.

## Brex

We use Brex as our primary credit card provider. Don't have a company card yet? Reach out to Maidul.
