## Overview

When integrating your infrastructure with Infisical Cloud, you may need to configure network access controls. This page provides the IP addresses that Infisical uses to communicate with your services.

## Egress IP Addresses

Infisical Cloud operates from two regions: US and EU. Depending on your region and security requirements, you may need to whitelist specific IP addresses to allow Infisical to communicate with your services.

### US Region

If you need Infisical US to reach your network, whitelist these IP addresses:

- `3.213.63.16`
- `54.164.68.7`

### EU Region

If you need Infisical EU to reach your network, whitelist these IP addresses:

- `3.77.89.19`
- `3.125.209.189`

## Common Use Cases

You might need to configure these IP addresses if you operate in a restricted network with the following Infisical features:

- Secret rotation - When Infisical needs to send requests to your systems to automatically rotate credentials
- Dynamic secrets - When Infisical generates and manages temporary credentials for your cloud services
- Secret integrations - When syncing secrets with third-party services like Azure Key Vault
- Native authentication with machine identities - When using methods like Kubernetes authentication
