title: "Enhancing Security and Usability: Project Upgrades"
---


At Infisical, we're constantly striving to elevate the security and usability standards of our platform to better serve our users.
With this commitment in mind, we're excited to introduce our latest addition, Non-E2EE projects, aimed at addressing two significant issues while enhancing overall project management.

Previously, users encountered a challenge wherein projects risked becoming inaccessible if the project creator departed or deleted their account.
Additionally, our API lacked the capability to interact with projects seamlessly.
These obstacles hindered the fluidity of automations and collaboration.

To overcome these limitations, our upgrade focuses on disabling end-to-end encryption (E2EE) for projects.
While this may raise eyebrows, it's essential to understand that this decision is a strategic move towards adopting industry-standard methods for securely storing sensitive information.

But what does this mean for our users? Essentially nothing, there are no changes required on your end. Rest assured, all sensitive data remains encrypted at rest, ensuring robust protection against unauthorized access. Instead, this transition opens doors to implementing alternative security measures, paving the way for a more automated and streamlined experience within Infisical.

By relinquishing E2EE, we're embracing a future where security protocols align with evolving industry standards.
This shift not only fortifies our platform but also empowers users with enhanced functionality and accessibility.
Our commitment to security remains unwavering, and this upgrade is a testament to our dedication to delivering on our promises in both security and usability.

Furthermore, as part of our commitment to providing a secure and user-friendly environment,
we are pleased to announce that all future projects created on Infisical will have end-to-end encryption (E2EE) disabled by default.
This proactive measure ensures consistency across all projects, aligning with our vision of adopting industry-standard security practices. With E2EE disabled from the outset,
users can seamlessly navigate their projects with confidence, knowing that their data is protected while enjoying enhanced collaboration and management capabilities.
