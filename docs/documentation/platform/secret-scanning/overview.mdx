## Introduction

Monitor and detect exposed secrets across your data sources, including code repositories, with Infisical Secret Scanning.

For additional security, we recommend using our [CLI Secret Scanner](/cli/scanning-overview#automatically-scan-changes-before-you-commit) to check for exposed secrets before pushing your code changes.

## How Secret Scanning Works

Secret Scanning consists of several components that enable you to quickly respond to secret leaks:

- **Scanner Engine**: The core component that analyzes your code and detects potential secrets using pattern matching and entropy analysis
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Provides continuous surveillance of your repositories for immediate detection of exposed secrets
- **Alert System**: Notifies organization admins via email when secrets are detected
- **Risk Management**: Allows tracking and managing detected secrets with different status options
- **Data Sources**: Integrates with various data sources and version control systems
- **Customizable Rules**: Supports ignore patterns and custom configurations to reduce false positives

These components work together to provide comprehensive secret detection and incident response capabilities.

### Data Sources

Data sources are configured integrations with external platforms, such as a GitHub organization or a GitLab group, that establish secure connections for scanning purposes using [App Connections](/integrations/app-connections/overview).

A data source acts as a secure intermediary between the external system and the scanner engine. It manages a collection of scannable resources (such as repositories) and handles the authentication and communication required for scanning operations.

### Resources

Resources are the atomic, scannable units, such as a repository, that can be monitored for secret exposure. Resources are added automatically when a data source is scanned and updated when scanning events are triggered, such as when a user pushes changes to GitHub.

Each resource maintains its own scanning history and status, allowing for granular monitoring and management of secret scanning across your organization.

### Scans

Scans can be initiated in two ways:

1. **Full Scan** - Manually triggered scan that comprehensively checks either all resources associated with a data source or a single selected resource.

2. **Diff Scan** - Automatically executed when **Auto-Scan** is enabled on a data source. This scan type specifically focuses on updates to existing resources.

All scan activities can be monitored in real-time through the Infisical UI, which displays:
- Current scan status
- Timestamp of the scan
- Resource(s) being scanned
- Detection results (whether any secrets were found)

### Findings

Findings are automatically generated when secret leaks are detected during scanning operations. Each finding contains comprehensive information including:
- The specific scanning rule that identified the leak
- File location and line number where the secret was found
- Resource-specific details (e.g., commit hash and author for Git repositories)

Findings are initially marked as **Unresolved** and can be updated to one of the following statuses with additional remarks:
- **Resolved** - The issue has been addressed
- **False Positive** - The detection was incorrect
- **Ignore** - The finding can be safely disregarded

These status options help teams effectively track and manage the lifecycle of detected secret leaks.

## Ignoring Known Secrets
If you're intentionally committing a test secret that the secret scanner might flag, you can instruct Infisical to overlook that secret with the methods listed below.

### infisical-scan:ignore

To ignore a secret contained in line of code, simply add `infisical-scan:ignore ` at the end of the line as comment in the given programming.

```js example.js
function helloWorld() {
    console.log("8dyfuiRyq=vVc3RRr_edRk-fK__JItpZ"); // infisical-scan:ignore
}
```

### .infisicalignore
An alternative method to exclude specific findings involves creating a .infisicalignore file at your repository's root.
You can then add the fingerprints of the findings you wish to exclude. The [Infisical scan](/cli/scanning-overview) report provides a unique Fingerprint for each secret found.
By incorporating these Fingerprints into the .infisicalignore file, Infisical will skip the corresponding secret findings in subsequent scans.
