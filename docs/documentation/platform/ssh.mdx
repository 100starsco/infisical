Infisical can be used to issue SSH certificates to provide short-lived, secure SSH access to your infrastructure.

## Concept

The following sequence diagram illustrates the client workflow for accessing a host using an SSH certificate (and optionally key pair)
supplied by Infisical.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Client as Client
  participant Infisical as Infisical (SSH CA)
  participant Host as Host

  Note over Client,Client: Step 1: Client Authentication with Infisical
  Client->>Infisical: Send credential(s) to authenticate with Infisical

  Infisical-->>Client: Return access token

  Note over Client,Infisical: Step 2: SSH Certificate Request
  Client->>Infisical: Make authenticated request for SSH certificate via either /api/v1/ssh/issue or /api/v1/ssh/sign

  Infisical-->>Client: Return signed SSH certificate (and optionally key pair)

  Note over Client,Client: Step 3: SSH Operation
  Client->>Host: SSH into Host using the SSH certificate

  Host-->>Client: Grant access to the host
```

TODO: Mention required configuration on the host.

At a high-level, Infisical issues a signed SSH certificate to a client that can be used to access a host.

To be more specific:

1. The client authenticates with Infisical; this can be done using a machine identity [authentication method](/documentation/platform/identities/machine-identities) or a user [authentication method](/documentation/platform/identities/user-identities).
2. The client makes an authenticated request for an SSH certificate via either the `/api/v1/ssh/issue` or `/api/v1/ssh/sign` endpoints. Note tha if the client wishes to use an existing SSH key pair, it can use the `/api/v1/ssh/sign` endpoint; otherwise, it can use the `/api/v1/ssh/issue` endpoint to have Infisical issue a new SSH key pair in conjunction with the certificate.
3. The client uses the issued SSH certificate (and potentially SSH key pair) to access the host.
