Infisical MySQL secret rotation allows you to automatically rotate your MySQL database user's password at regular intervals.

<Warning>
	At present Infisical do require access to your database. We will soon be released Infisical agent based rotation which would help you rotate without direct database access from Infisical cloud.
</Warning>

## Prerequisite

1. Create two users with the required permission in your MySQL instance. Let's call them `user-a` and `user-b`.
2. Create another MySQL user with permission to update the passwords of `user-a` and `user-b`. Let's call it `admin`

To learn more about MySQL Permissioning, please follow this [documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/privileges-provided.html).

## Working

1. Infisical connects to your database using the provided `admin` user account.
2. A random value is generated and the password for `user-a` is updated with the new value.
3. The new password is then tested by logging into the database
4. If test is success, its saved to the output secret mappings so that rest of the system gets access.
5. The process is then repeated for `user-b` on the next rotation.
6. And the loop continues.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why can't we delete the other user when rotating?">
  	When a system has multiple nodes by horizontal scaling, redeployment doesn't happen instantly.

	This means that when the secrets are rotated, and the redeployment is triggered, the existing system will still be using the old credentials until the change rolls out. 

	To avoid causing failure for them, the old credentials are not removed. Instead, in the next rotation, the previous user's credentials are updated.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why do you need root user account?">
	The rotatora account is used by Infisical to update the credentials for `user-a` and `user-b`. 

	You don't need to grant all permission for it. SQL has an amazing permission system, which means that the admin user only requires permission to update both the user passwords.

## Rotation Configuration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Secret Rotation Page">
	Head over to Secret Rotation configuration page of your project by clicking on `Secret Rotation` in the left side bar 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click on MySQL Card" />
  <Step title="Provide the inputs">
  	These are inputs required by MySQL Rotation Providers

		Database host url
	- Port 
		Database port number

		The first username in two to rotate - `user-a`

	- Username2

		The second username in two to rotate - `user-b`

	- CA
		
		Certificate to connect with database(string)  
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the output secret mapping">
  	The secret keys to be replaced in the provided board after successful secret rotation

	- Select `Environment`, `Secret Path` and `Interval` to rotate the secrets
	- Finally select the secrets in your provided board to replace with new secret after each rotation

		- DB Username

			The rotated database username.

		- DB Password

			The new generated credentials for the database user.

	- Your done and good to go.
