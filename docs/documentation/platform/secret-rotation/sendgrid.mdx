Twilio SendGrid is a cloud-based email delivery platform that helps businesses send transactional and marketing emails.
It uses an API key to do various operations. Using Infisical you can easily dynamically change the keys.

## Prerequisite

A valid SendGrid admin key with the necessary scope to create additional API keys. Additionally, make sure that your new API keys have the required scopes to perform the desired tasks.

Follow the [SendGrid Docs to create an admin api key](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/api-keys)

## Working

1. Using the provided admin key and the given scope in input Infisical will create and rotate API keys periodically
2. Under the hood infisical uses [SendGrid API](https://docs.sendgrid.com/api-reference/api-keys/create-api-keys)

## Rotation Configuration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Secret Rotation Page">
	Head over to Secret Rotation configuration page of your project by clicking on `Secret Rotation` in the left side bar

  <Step title="Click on Twilio SendGrid Card" />
