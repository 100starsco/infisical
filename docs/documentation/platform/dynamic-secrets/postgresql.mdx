The Infisical MySQL secret rotation allows you to automatically rotate your MySQL database user's password at a predefined interval.


## Prerequisite

1. Create a user with the required permission in your SQL instance. We'll refer to them as `user-a` and `user-b`.
2. Create another MySQL user with just the permission to update the passwords of `user-a` and `user-b`. We'll refer to this user as the `admin` user.

To learn more about MySQL permission system, please visit this [documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/privileges-provided.html).

## How it works 

1. Infisical connects to your database using the provided `admin` user account.
2. A random value is generated and the password for `user-a` is updated with the new value.
3. The new password is then tested by logging into the database
4. If test is success, it's saved to the output secret mappings so that rest of the system gets the newly rotated value(s).
5. The process is then repeated for `user-b` on the next rotation.
6. The cycle repeats until secret rotation is deleted/stopped.

## Rotation Configuration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Secret Overview Dashboard">
	Head over to Secret Rotation configuration page of your project by clicking on `Secret Rotation` in the left side bar 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click on the `Add Dynamic Secret` button">
	![Add Dynamic Secret Button](../../../images/platform/dynamic-secrets/add-dynamic-secret-button.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select `SQL Database`">
	![Dynamic Secret Modal](../../../images/platform/dynamic-secrets/dynamic-secret-modal.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Provide the inputs for dynamic secret parameters">
	<ParamField path="Secret Name" type="string" required>
		Name by which you want the secret to be referenced
	</ParamField>

	<ParamField path="Default TTL" type="string" required>
		Default time-to-live for a generated secret (it is possible to modify this value when a secret is generate)
	</ParamField>

	<ParamField path="Max TTL" type="string" required>
		Maximum time-to-live for a generated secret
	</ParamField>

	<ParamField path="Service" type="string" required>
		Choose the service you want to generate dynamic secrets for
	</ParamField>

	<ParamField path="Host" type="string" required>
		Database host
	</ParamField>

	<ParamField path="Port" type="number" required>
		Database port
	</ParamField>

	<ParamField path="User" type="string" required>
		Username that will be used to create dynamic secrets
	</ParamField>

	<ParamField path="Password" type="string" required>
		Password that will be used to create dynamic secrets
	</ParamField>

	<ParamField path="Database Name" type="string" required>
		Name of the database for which you want to create dynamic secrets
	</ParamField>
 
	<ParamField path="CA(SSL)" type="string">
		Optional database certificate to connect with database
	</ParamField>

  </Step>
  <Step title="(Optional) Modify SQL Statements">
  	If you want to provide specific privileges for the future generated dynamic secrets, you are able to specify them as SQL statements. 

	![Modify SQL Statements Modal](../../../images/platform/dynamic-secrets/modify-sql-statements.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click `Submit`">
  	After submitting the form, you will see a dynamic secret creates in the dashboard. 

	<Note>
		If this step fails, you might have to add the CA certficate. 
	</Note>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate dynamic secrets">
	Now that the dynamic secret is created, you can start generating unique secret values by specifying the Time-to-live within the predefined range.
