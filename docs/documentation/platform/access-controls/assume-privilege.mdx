## Overview

The Assume Privileges feature allows authorized users to temporarily gain the permissions of another user or identity within the system.
This capability enables administrators to troubleshoot issues, perform maintenance tasks, or assist users without requiring permanent access to their accounts.

## How It Works

When an authorized user activates the Assume Privileges feature, they temporarily inherit the exact permissions of the target user or identity for a limited time period (1 hour).
During this period, they can perform actions within the system as if they had the same permission level as the target user.

- **Permission-based**: Only transfers permissions, not the complete identity
- **Time-limited**: Access automatically expires after 1 hour
- **Audited**: All actions performed during the privilege assumption are logged under the original user's credentials
- **Authorization-required**: Only users with specific **assume privilege** permission can use this feature

### Distinction from Impersonation

Unlike impersonation, Assume Privileges:

1. Does not change the user's display name or identity in the system
2. Records all actions under the original user's ID (not the target user)
3. Only provides access to permissions, not personal settings or data
4. Is designed for administrative and support purposes within proper authorization boundaries

## Steps

1. Navigate to Project Access and select a user/identity by clicking on their row in the table
   ![Access control page](/images/platform/access-controls/assume-privileges/access-control.png)
2. Click the Assume Privilege button and type in assume to confirm and start your session
   ![Access control detail page](/images/platform/access-controls/assume-privileges/access-control-detail.png)
3. A yellow alert session will appear showing your active assume privilege session; you can exit at any time by clicking the \*\*Exit button

<Info>
  The assume privilege session is scoped to a single project and will expire
  after 1 hour. A user can only assume privileges for one project at a time.
