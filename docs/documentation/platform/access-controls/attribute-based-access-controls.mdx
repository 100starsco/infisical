Infisical's Attribute-based Access Controls (ABAC) allow for dynamic, attribute-driven permissions for both user and machine identities.
ABAC policies use metadata attributes—stored as key-value pairs on identities—to enforce fine-grained permissions that are context aware.

In ABAC, access controls are defined using metadata attributes, such as location or department, which can be set directly on user or machine identities.
During policy execution, these attributes are evaluated, and determine whether said actor can access the requested resource or perform the requested operation.

## Project-level Permissions

Attribute-based access controls are currently available for polices defined on projects. You can set ABAC permissions to control access to environments, folders, secrets, and secret tags.

    For organizations using SAML for login, Infisical automatically maps
    metadata attributes from SAML assertions to user identities. This makes it
    easy to create policies that dynamically adapt based on the SAML user’s
    attributes.

## Defining ABAC Policies

<img src="/images/platform/access-controls/example-abac-1.png" />

ABAC policies make use of identity metadata to define dynamic permissions. Each attribute must start and end with double curly-brackets `{{ <attribute-name> }}`.
The following attributes are available within project permissions:

- **User ID**: `{{ identity.id }}`
- **Username**: `{{ identity.username }}`
- **Metadata Attributes**: `{{ identity.metadata.<metadata-key-name> }}`

During policy execution, these placeholders are replaced by their actual values prior to evaluation.

## Access Attributes from Machine Identity Login

When authenticating with machine identity providers like OIDC, your login process may include additional attributes or claims that can be used for making permission decisions.
These attributes can be mapped to your access control policies to provide fine-grained, attribute-based access control (ABAC).

### Using OIDC Authentication Attributes

After authenticating via OIDC, you can access the claims provided by your identity provider and use them in permission decisions:

1.  Navigate to the Identity Authentication settings and select the OIDC Auth Method.
2.  In the **Advanced section**, find the Claim Mapping configuration.
3.  Map the OIDC claims to permission attributes by specifying:

        		- **Attribute Name**: The name that will be used in your permission policies
        		- **Claim Path**: The dot notation path to the claim in the OIDC token (e.g., user.department)

<img src="/images/platform/access-controls/abac-policies-by-auth.png" />

For example, if your OIDC provider returns claims like

```json
{
  "sub": "user123",
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "user": {
    "department": "engineering",
    "role": "developer"
  }
}
```

You could create mappings like:

- Attribute Name: **department**, Claim Path: **user.department**
- Attribute Name: **user_role**, Claim Path: **user.role**

Once configured, these attributes will be included in the access token after login and can be referenced in permission policies:

<Info>
  Currently, only OIDC authentication is supported. Support for Kubernetes and
  other authentication methods is planned for future releases.{" "}

### OIDC Authentication

- **OIDC Bound Claims**: `{{ identity.auth.oidc.claims.<permission claim name> }}`

### Example Use Case

#### Location-based Access Control

Suppose you want to restrict access to secrets within a specific folder based on a user's geographic region.
You could assign a `location` attribute to each user (e.g., `identity.metadata.location`).
You could then structure your folders to align with this attribute and define permissions accordingly.

For example, a policy might restrict access to folders matching the user's location attribute in the following pattern:

```
/appA/{{ identity.metadata.location }}
```

Using this structure, users can only access folders that correspond to their configured `location` attribute.
Consequently, if a users attribute changes due to relocation, no policies need to be changed to gain access to the folders associated with their new location.
