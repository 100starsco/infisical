In certain situations, developers need to expand their access to certain new project or a sensitive environment. For those use cases, it is helpful to utilize Infisical's **Access Requests** functionality. 

This functionality works in the following way: 
1. A project administrator sets up a policy that assigns access managers to a certain sensitive folder or environment. 
2. When a developer requests access to one of such sensitive resources, corresponding access managers get an email notification about it.
3. An access manager can approve or deny the access request as well as specify the duration of access in the case of approval. 
4. As soon as the request is approved, developer is able to access the sought resources.
