Developers frequently need to share secrets with team members, contractors, or other third parties, which can be risky due to potential leaks or misuse.
Infisical offers a secure solution for sharing secrets over the internet in a time-bound manner as well as view count bound manner.

With its zero-knowledge architecture, secrets shared via Infisical remain unreadable even to Infisical itself.

## Share a Secret

1. Navigate to the **Organization** page.
2. Click on the **Secret Sharing** tab from the sidebar.

<Note>
  Infisical does not have access to the shared secrets. This is a part of our
  zero knowledge architecture.

3. Click on the **Share Secret** button.

   a. Time-bound secret: Set the expiration time in minutes, hours, days, or weeks.

   b. View Count-bound secret: Set the number of views after which the secret will expire.

<Note>
  Secret once set cannot be changed. This is to ensure that the secret is not
  tampered with.
</Note>

5. Copy the link and share it with the intended recipient. Anyone with the link can access the secret before its expiration condition. Hence, it is recommended to share the link only with the intended recipient.
