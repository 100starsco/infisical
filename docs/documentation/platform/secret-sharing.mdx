Developers frequently need to share secrets with team members, contractors, or other third parties, which can be risky due to potential leaks or misuse.
Infisical offers a secure solution for sharing secrets over the internet in a time and view count bound manner.

With its zero-knowledge architecture, secrets shared via Infisical remain unreadable even to Infisical itself.

<Note>
  Secret Sharing is available publicly as well as from the Infisical dashboard.
  If you're signed in, you can access all your shared secrets and their expiry
  details.
</Note>

## Share a Secret

1. Navigate to the **Organization** page.
2. Click on the **Secret Sharing** tab from the sidebar.

<Note>
  Infisical does not have access to the shared secrets. This is a part of our
  zero knowledge architecture.
</Note>

3. Click on the **Share Secret** button. Set the secret, its expiration time as well as the number of views allowed. It expires as soon as any of the conditions are met.

<Note>
  Secret once set cannot be changed. This is to ensure that the secret is not
  tampered with.
</Note>

5. Copy the link and share it with the intended recipient. Anyone with the link can access the secret before its expiration condition. Hence, it is recommended to share the link only with the intended recipient.
