description: "Run Infisical with Docker"
---

Prerequisites:
- Basic knowledge of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- Have Docker installed on your system. If not, follow the installation guide [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

Infisical is available as a single Docker image for effortless deployment.
This Docker image solely includes the application code, meaning you must supply a connection to a Postgres database and a Redis instance.
The following guide provides a detailed step-by-step walkthrough on how you can deploy Infisical.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pull the Infisical Docker image">
    Visit [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/infisical/infisical/tags) and select a version of Infisical image you would like to deploy.
    Then run the following command in your terminal to pull the specific Infisical Docker image.
    
    ```
    docker pull infisical/infisical:<version>
    ```
    
    Remember to replace `<version>` with the docker image tag of your choice.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run Postgres schema migration ">
    Before you can start the instance of Infisical, you need to run the database schema migrations. 
    Follow the step by [step guide here](/self-hosting/configuration/schema-migrations) on running schema migrations.
    
    ```
    docker pull infisical/infisical:<version>
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Infisical">
    For a minimal installation of Infisical, you need to configure `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `AUTH_SECRET`, `DB_CONNECTION_URI`, and `REDIS_URL`.
    View all available environment variables [here](/self-hosting/configuration/envars).
    
    Once you have added the required environment variables to your docker run command, execute it in your terminal to get Infisical up and running.
    
    For example:

    ```bash
    docker run -p 80:8080  \
    -e ENCRYPTION_KEY=f40c9178624764ad85a6830b37ce239a \
    -e AUTH_SECRET="q6LRi7c717a3DQ8JUxlWYkZpMhG4+RHLoFUVt3Bvo2U=" \
    -e DB_CONNECTION_URI="<>" \
    -e REDIS_URL="<>" \
    infisical/infisical:<version>
    ```
    
    <Warning>
      The above environment variable values are only to be used as an example and should not be used in production 
    </Warning>
    
    Once the container is running, verify the installation by opening your web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:80`.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What are the system requirements for running Infisical?">
    To have a functional deployment, we recommended compute with 2GB of RAM and 1 CPU.
    
    However, depending on your usage, you may need to further scale up system resources to meet demand.
