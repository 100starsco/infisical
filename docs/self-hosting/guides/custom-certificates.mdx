Follow these steps to configure trust for custom certificates. This is helpful for connecting Infisical with self-hosted services like GitLab.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Standalone Infisical image
- Certificate public key `.pem` files

## Setup

1. Place all your public key `.pem` files in a single directory.
2. Mount the directory containing the `.pem` files to the `usr/local/share/ca-certificates/` path in the Infisical container.
3. Add the following environment variable to the Infisical container's configuration:
   ```
   NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
   ```
4. Start the Infisical container.

By following these steps, your Infisical container will trust the specified certificates, allowing you to securely connect Infisical to your other services.
