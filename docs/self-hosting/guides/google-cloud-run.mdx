This guide will provide step by step instructions on how to self-host Infisical using Cloud Run.

## Configuration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get the Infisical Docker image">
    Visit [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/infisical/infisical/tags) and select a version of Infisical image you would like to deploy.
    Then paste the url of the specific Infisical Docker image you would like to use within the `Container image URL` field.

    Remember to replace `<version>` with the docker image tag of your choice.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set the environment variables">
    For a minimal installation of Infisical, you must configure `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `AUTH_SECRET`, `DB_CONNECTION_URI`, `SITE_URL`, and `REDIS_URL`.     [View all available configurations](/self-hosting/configuration/envars).
    
    You will want to setup Postgres and Redis within Google Cloud Platform to connect to Infisical.

    Once you have added the required environment variables to the `Environment Variables` section within Cloud Run, 
    create the container to get Infisical up and running.
