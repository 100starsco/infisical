description: "Architecture overview for Infisical's US and EU cloud deployments"
---

This document provides an overview of Infisical's cloud architecture for our US and EU deployments, detailing the core components and how they interact to provide security and infrastructure services.

## Overview

Infisical Cloud operates on AWS infrastructure using containerized services deployed via Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service). Our US and EU deployments use identical architectural patterns to ensure consistency and reliability across regions.

## Components

A typical Infisical Cloud deployment consists of the following components:

### Application Services

- **Infisical Core**: Main application server running the Infisical backend API
- **License API**: Dedicated API service for license management with separate RDS instance (shared between US/EU)
- **Application Load Balancer**: Routes incoming traffic to application containers with SSL termination and host-based routing

### Data Layer

- **Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL)**:
  - **Main RDS Instance**: Primary database for secrets, users, and metadata (Multi-AZ, encryption enabled)
  - **License API RDS Instance**: Dedicated database for license management services
- **Amazon ElastiCache (Redis)**:
  - **Main Redis Cluster**: Multi-AZ replication group for core application caching and queuing
  - **License API Redis**: Dedicated cache for license services
  - Redis 7 engine with CloudWatch logging and snapshot backups

### Infrastructure

- **ECS Fargate**: Serverless container platform running application services
- **AWS Global Accelerator**: Global traffic routing and performance optimization
- **Cloudflare**: DNS management and routing
- **AWS SSM Parameter Store**: Stores application configuration and secrets
- **CloudWatch**: Centralized logging and monitoring

## System Layout

### Service Architecture

The Infisical application runs as multiple containerized services on ECS:

- **Main Server**: 10-30 instances (2048 CPU, 4096 MB memory) with auto-scaling
- **License API**: 2-4 instances (2048 CPU, 4096 MB memory) with dedicated infrastructure (shared globally)
- **Monitoring**: AWS OTel Collector and Datadog Agent sidecars

Container images are pulled from Docker Hub and managed via GitHub Actions for deployments.

### Network Configuration

Services are deployed in private subnets with the following connectivity:

- External traffic → Application Load Balancer → ECS Services
- Main server exposes port 8080
- License API exposes port 4000 (portal.infisical.com, license.infisical.com)
- Service-to-service communication via AWS Service Connect

### Data Flow

1. **DNS resolution** via Cloudflare routes traffic to AWS Global Accelerator
2. **Global Accelerator** optimizes routing to the nearest AWS region
3. **Client requests** are routed through the Application Load Balancer to ECS containers
4. **Application logic** processes requests in the Infisical Core service
5. **Data persistence** occurs via encrypted connections to RDS
6. **Caching** utilizes ElastiCache for performance optimization
7. **Configuration** is retrieved from AWS SSM Parameter Store

## Regional Deployments

### US Cloud (us.infisical.com or app.infisical.com)

- **Cluster**: `infisical-core-platform` ECS cluster
- **Scaling**: 10-30 main server instances, 2-4 license server instances
- **Monitoring**: Integrated with Datadog

### EU Cloud (eu.infisical.com)

- **Cluster**: `infisical-core-platform` ECS cluster
- **Scaling**: 15-30 main server instances, 2-4 license server instances
- **Monitoring**: Integrated with Datadog
- **Compliance**: GDPR compliant with data residency within EU

## Configuration Management

Application configuration and secrets are managed through AWS SSM Parameter Store, with deployment automation handled via GitHub Actions.

## Monitoring and Observability

### Logging

- **CloudWatch**: 365-day retention for application logs
- **Health Checks**: HTTP endpoint monitoring for service health

### Metrics

- **AWS OTel Collector**: Prometheus metrics collection
- **Datadog Agent**: Application performance monitoring and infrastructure metrics
- **Auto Scaling**: CPU and memory-based scaling triggers at 60% utilization

## Container Management

- **Images**: `infisical/staging_infisical` and `infisical/license-server` from Docker Hub
- **Deployment**: Automated via GitHub Actions updating SSM parameter for image tags
- **Registry Access**: Docker Hub credentials stored in AWS Secrets Manager
- **Platform**: ECS Fargate with 70% standard capacity, 30% Spot instances

## Security Overview

### Data Protection

- **Encryption**: All secrets encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Network Isolation**: Services deployed in private subnets with controlled access
- **Authentication**: API tokens and service accounts for secure access
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails for all secret operations

### Network Architecture

- **VPC Design**: Dedicated VPC with public and private subnets across multiple Availability Zones
- **NAT Gateway**: All outbound traffic from private subnets routes through NAT Gateway for external connectivity
- **Load Balancing**: Application Load Balancer with SSL termination and health checks
- **Service Communication**: AWS Service Connect for internal service discovery
- **Security Groups**: Restrictive firewall rules (port 8080 for main server, 4000 for license API)
- **High Availability**: Multi-AZ deployment with automatic failover
- **Network Monitoring**: VPC Flow Logs with 365-day retention for traffic analysis
