description: "Learn how to sync secrets from Infisical to AWS Secrets Manager without sharing any user credentials."
---

Prerequisites:

- Set up and add envars to [Infisical Cloud](https://app.infisical.com)

<Accordion title="Self-Hosted Users">
  To connect your Infisical instance with AWS, you need to set up an AWS IAM User account that can assume the AWS IAM Role for the integration.

  <Steps>
    <Step title="Create an IAM User">
      Navigate to [Create IAM User](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home#/users/create) in your AWS Console.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create an Inline Policy">
      Attach the following inline permission policy to the IAM User to allow it to assume any IAM Roles:
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowAssumeAnyRole",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::*:role/*"
    }
  ]
}
```
</Step>
<Step title="Obtain the IAM User Credentials">
  Obtain the AWS access key ID and secret access key for your IAM User by navigating to IAM > Users > [Your User] > Security credentials > Access keys.

  ![Access Key Step 1](../../images/integrations/aws/integrations-aws-access-key-1.png)
  ![Access Key Step 2](../../images/integrations/aws/integrations-aws-access-key-2.png)
  ![Access Key Step 3](../../images/integrations/aws/integrations-aws-access-key-3.png)
</Step>
<Step title="Set Up Integration Keys">
  1. Set the access key as **CLIENT_ID_AWS_INTEGRATION**.
  2. Set the secret key as **CLIENT_SECRET_AWS_INTEGRATION**.
</Step>
</Steps>
</Accordion>

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create the Managing User IAM Role for AWS Secrets Manager">
    1. Navigate to the [Create IAM Role](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home#/roles/create?step=selectEntities) page in your AWS Console.
       ![IAM Role Creation](../../images/integrations/aws/integration-aws-iam-assume-role.png)

    2. Select **AWS Account** as the **Trusted Entity Type**.
    3. Choose **Another AWS Account** and enter **381492033652** (Infisical AWS Account ID). This restricts the role to be assumed only by Infisical. If self-hosting, provide your AWS account number instead.
    4. Optionally, enable **Require external ID** and enter your **project ID** to further enhance security.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Required Permissions for the IAM Role">
    ![IAM Role Permissions](../../images/integrations/aws/integration-aws-iam-assume-permission.png)
    Use the following custom policy to grant the minimum permissions required by Infisical to sync secrets to AWS Secrets Manager:

    ```json
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Sid": "AllowSecretsManagerAccess",
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": [
            "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",
            "secretsmanager:CreateSecret",
            "secretsmanager:UpdateSecret",
            "secretsmanager:DescribeSecret",
            "secretsmanager:TagResource",
            "secretsmanager:UntagResource",
            "kms:ListKeys",
            "kms:ListAliases",
            "kms:Encrypt",
            "kms:Decrypt"
          ],
          "Resource": "*"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Copy the AWS IAM Role ARN">
    ![Copy IAM Role ARN](../../images/integrations/aws/integration-aws-iam-assume-arn.png)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authorize Infisical for AWS Secrets Manager">
    1. Navigate to your project's integrations tab in Infisical.
    2. Click on the **AWS Secrets Manager** tile.
       ![Select AWS Secrets Manager](../../images/integrations.png)

    3. Select the **AWS Assume Role** option.
       ![Select Assume Role](../../images/integrations/aws/integration-aws-iam-assume-select.png)

    4. Provide the **AWS IAM Role ARN** obtained from the previous step.
  </Step>  <Step title="Start integration">
    Select how you want to integration to work by specifying a number of parameters:

    <ParamField path="Project Environment" type="string" required>
      The environment in Infisical from which you want to sync secrets to AWS Secrets Manager.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField path="Secrets Path" type="string" required>
      The path within the preselected environment form which you want to sync secrets to AWS Secrets Manager.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField path="AWS Region" type="string" required>
      The region that you want to integrate with in AWS Secrets Manager.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField path="Mapping Behavior" type="string" required>
      How you want the integration to map the secrets. The selected value could be either one to one or one to many.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField path="AWS SM Secret Name" type="string" required>
      The secret name/path in AWS into which you want to sync the secrets from Infisical.
    </ParamField>

    ![integration create](../../images/integrations/aws/integrations-aws-secret-manager-create.png)

    Optionally, you can add tags or specify the encryption key of all the secrets created via this integration:

    <ParamField path="Secret Tag" type="string" optional>
      The Key/Value of a tag that will be added to secrets in AWS. Please note that it is possible to add multiple tags via API.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField path="Encryption Key" type="string" optional>
      The alias/ID of the AWS KMS key used for encryption. Please note that key should be enabled in order to work and the IAM user should have access to it.
    </ParamField>
    ![integration options](../../images/integrations/aws/integrations-aws-secret-manager-options.png)

    Then, press `Create Integration` to start syncing secrets to AWS Secrets Manager.

    <Info>
      Infisical currently syncs environment variables to AWS Secrets Manager as
      key-value pairs under one secret. We're actively exploring ways to help users
      group environment variable key-pairs under multiple secrets for greater
      control.
    </Info>
    <Info>
      Please note that upon deleting secrets in Infisical, AWS Secrets Manager immediately makes the secrets inaccessible but only schedules them for deletion after at least 7 days.
