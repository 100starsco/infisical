---

The documentation for using Infisical to manage secrets in Ansible is currently available [here](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/repo/published/infisical/vault/).


If you get this Python error when you running the lookup plugin:-

```
objc[72832]: +[__NSCFConstantString initialize] may have been in progress in another thread when fork() was called. We cannot safely call it or ignore it in the fork() child process. Crashing instead. Set a breakpoint on objc_initializeAfterForkError to debug.
Fatal Python error: Aborted
```

You will need to add this to your shell environment or ansible wrapper script:-

```
export OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY=YES
```
