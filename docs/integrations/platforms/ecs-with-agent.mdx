This guide will go over the steps needed to access secrets stored in Infisical from within Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS). 

At a high level, the steps involve setting up an ECS task with a [Infisical Agent](/) sidecar container. This sidecar container uses Universal Auth to communicate with Infisical to fetch secrets/access tokens.
Once the secrets/access tokens are retrieved, they are then stored in a shared Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) volume. This volume is then made accessible to your application and all of its replicas.

This guide primarily focuses on integrating Infisical Cloud with Amazon ECS on AWS Fargate and Amazon EFS.
However, the principles and steps can be adapted for use with any instance of Infisical (on premise or cloud) and different ECS configurations.

## Prerequisites
This guide requires the following prerequisites:
- Infisical account 
- Git installed
- Terraform v1.0 or later installed
- Access to AWS credentials
- Understanding of [Infisical Agent](/)

## What we will deploy

For the purpose of this demonstration, we will deploy [File Browser](https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser) to our ECS cluster.
This will enable us to easily confirm that the Infisical agent is indeed depositing the credentials into the specified volume accessible to file browser deployed. 
Of course, in production the volumes where your secrets reside should never be exposed to the public.


## Configure Authentication with Infisical
In order for the Infisical agent to fetch credentials from Infisical, we'll first need to authenticate with Infisical.
While Infisical supports various authentication methods, this guide focuses on using Universal Auth to authenticate the agent with Infisical.

Follow the documentation to configure and generate a client id and client secret with Universal auth [here](/documentation/platform/identities/universal-auth).
Make sure to save these credentials somewhere handy because you'll need them soon.

## Clone guide assets repository
To help you quickly deploy the example application, please clone the guide assets from this [Github repository](https://github.com/Infisical/infisical-guides.git).
This repository contains assets for all Infisical guides. The content for this guide can be found within a sub directory called `aws-ecs-with-agent`. 
The guide will assume that `aws-ecs-with-agent` is your working directory going forward.

## Deploy example application

Before we can deploy our full application and its related infrastructure with Terraform, we'll need to make a few changes.
Mainly, we'll need to configure our Infisical agent config file.

### Agent configuration overview
The agent config file defines what authentication method will be used when connecting with Infisical along with where the fetched secrets/access tokens should be saved to.

Since the Infisical agent will be deployed as a sidecar, the agent configuration file and any secret template files will need to be encoded in base64. 
This encoding step is necessary as it allows these files to be added into our Terraform configuration file without needing to upload them first.

#### Secret template file
The Infisical agent accepts one or more optional template files. If provided, the agent will fetch secrets using the set authentication method and format the fetched secrets according to the given template file. 

For demonstration purposes, we will create the following secret template file. 
This template will transform our secrets from Infisical project with the ID `62fd92aa8b63973fee23dec7`, in the `dev` environment, and secrets located in the path `/`, into a `KEY=VALUE` format. 

<Tip>
  Remember to update the project id, environment slug and secret path to one that exists within your Infisical project
</Tip>

```secrets.template secrets.template
{{- with secret "62fd92aa8b63973fee23dec7" "dev" "/" }}
{{- range . }}
{{ .Key }}={{ .Value }}
{{- end }}
{{- end }}
```

Next, we need encode this template file in `base64` so it can be set in your agent configuration file.

```bash
cat secrets.template | base64 
e3stIHdpdGggc2VjcmV0ICI2MmZkOTJhYThiNjM5NzNmZWUyM2RlYzciICJkZXYiICIvIiB9fQp7ey0gcmFuZ2UgLiB9fQp7eyAuS2V5IH19PXt7IC5WYWx1ZSB9fQp7ey0gZW5kIH19Cnt7LSBlbmQgfX0=
```

#### Full agent configuration file

```

## Add auth credentials & agent config
Before we can execute our Terraform configuration files, we need to set the previously created Universal Auth credentials and the base64 encoded agent configuration file in our Terraform. 

To configure these values, navigate to the `ecs.tf` file in your preferred code editor and assign values to `auth_client_id`, `auth_client_secret`, and `agent_config`. 
You should already have these values from the previous steps. 

```terraform ecs.tf
...snip...
data "template_file" "cb_app" {
  template = file("./templates/ecs/cb_app.json.tpl")

  vars = {
    app_image          = var.app_image
    sidecar_image      = var.sidecar_image
    app_port           = var.app_port
    fargate_cpu        = var.fargate_cpu
    fargate_memory     = var.fargate_memory
    aws_region         = var.aws_region
    auth_client_id     = "faf7da54-75e1-43aa-84be-06453f0b8fc4"
    auth_client_secret = "cb8597f1d5bee779a657e863e5f73c8d4761f3e0c3f6d05c9c2820bc96a0a6f1"
    agent_config       = "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"
  }
}
...snip...
```

After these values have been set, they will be passed to the Infisical agent during startup through environment variables, as configured in the `infisical-sidecar` container below.

      },
      {

        "value": "${agent_config}"
      }
    ],
    "mountPoints": [
      {
          "containerPath": "/infisical-agent",
          "sourceVolume": "infisical-efs"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

<Warning>
  To keep this guide simple, `auth_client_id`, `auth_client_secret` have been added directly into the ECS container definition. 
  However, in production you should securely fetch these values from AWS Secrets Manager or AWS Parameter store and feed them directly to agent sidecar. 
</Warning>

## Configure AWS credentials
Because we'll be deploying the example application to AWS via Terraform, you will need to obtain a set of `AWS Access Key` and `Secret Key`.
Once you have generated these credentials, export them to your terminal. 

1. Export the AWS Access Key ID:

   ```bash
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your AWS access key ID>
   ```

2. Export the AWS Secret Access Key:

   ```bash
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your AWS secret access key>
   ```

3. Export the AWS Session Token:

   ```bash
   export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=<your AWS session token>
   ```

## Deploy terraform configuration
Now that we have completed the necessary configuration for the agent to be used as a sidecar, we are ready to deploy our changes to AWS via Terraform.

1. Make sure your current directory is set to `aws-ecs-with-agent`. Once there, change your directory to `terraform`
```sh 
cd terraform
```

2. Initialize Terraform
```
$ terraform init 
```

3. Preview resources that will be created 
```
$ terraform plan
```

4. Trigger resource creation
```bash
$ terraform apply 

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes
```

```bash

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 1 changed, 1 destroyed.

Outputs:

alb_hostname = "cb-load-balancer-1675475779.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com:8080"
```

Once the resources have been successfully deloyed, Terrafrom will output the host address where our application will be accessible.
It may take a few minutes for the application to become fully ready ready. 


## Verify secrets/tokens in EFS volume
To verify that the agent is depositing access tokens and rendering secrets to files, visit the web address from the previous step.
Once you visit the address, you'll be prompted to login. Enter the credentials shown below.

![file browser main login page](/images/guides/agent-with-ecs/file_browser_main.png)

Since our EFS volume is mounted to the path of the file browser, we should see the access token and rendered secret file we configured via the agent config file. 
While secrets should never be shown in this fashion, the file browser allows us to demonstrate how credentials can be delivered to applications of any kind within ECS.
