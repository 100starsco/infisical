```bash
infisical bootstrap --domain=<domain> --email=<email> --password=<password> --organization=<organization>
```

## Description

The `infisical bootstrap` command is used when deploying Infisical in automated environments where manual UI setup is not feasible. It's ideal for:

- Containerized deployments in Kubernetes or Docker environments
- Infrastructure-as-code pipelines with Terraform or similar tools
- Continuous deployment workflows
- DevOps automation scenarios

The command initializes a fresh Infisical instance by creating an admin user, organization, and instance admin machine identity, enabling subsequent programmatic configuration without human intervention.

**Security Warning**: This command creates an instance admin machine identity with the highest level of privileges. The returned token should be treated with the utmost security, similar to a root credential. Unauthorized access to this token could compromise your entire Infisical instance.

## Flags

<Accordion title="--domain" defaultOpen="true">
  The URL of your Infisical instance.

  ```bash
  # Example
  infisical bootstrap --domain=https://your-infisical-instance.com
  ```

  This flag is required.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="--email">
  Email address for the admin user account that will be created.

  ```bash
  # Example
  infisical bootstrap --email=admin@example.com
  ```

  This flag is required.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="--password">
  Password for the admin user account.

  ```bash
  # Example
  infisical bootstrap --password=your-secure-password
  ```

  This flag is required.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="--organization">
  Name of the organization that will be created within the instance.

  ```bash
  # Example
  infisical bootstrap --organization=your-org-name
  ```

  This flag is required.
</Accordion>

## Response

The command returns a JSON response with details about the created user, organization, and machine identity:

```json
{
    "message": "Successfully initialized instance",
    "user": {
        "id": "911d6d11-2bf8-4f1b-861d-6a0ec43e7e1a",
        "email": "admin@example.com",
        "authMethods": [
            "email"
        ],
        "superAdmin": true,
        "firstName": "Admin",
        "lastName": "User",
        "isAccepted": true,
        "isMfaEnabled": false,
        // Additional user properties...
    },
    "organization": {
        "id": "65a54d51-cac9-418a-ae17-20bfc715c6df",
        "name": "your-org-name",
        "slug": "your-org-name-xxxx",
        "createdAt": "2025-03-17T11:11:41.564Z",
        "updatedAt": "2025-03-17T11:11:41.564Z",
        // Additional organization properties...
    },
    "identity": {
        "id": "4fa39767-39ce-440f-bb00-f6aae64b3dd5",
        "name": "Admin Identity",
        "authMethod": null,
        "createdAt": "2025-03-17T11:11:41.569Z",
        "updatedAt": "2025-03-17T11:11:41.569Z",
        "credentials": {
            "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
        }
    }
}
```

## Usage with Automation

For automation purposes, you can extract just the machine identity token from the response:

```bash
infisical bootstrap --domain=https://your-infisical-instance.com --email=admin@example.com --password=your-secure-password --organization=your-org-name | jq ".identity.credentials.token"
```

This extracts only the token, which can be captured in a variable or piped to other commands.

## Example: Capture Token in a Variable

```bash
TOKEN=$(infisical bootstrap --domain=https://your-infisical-instance.com --email=admin@example.com --password=your-secure-password --organization=your-org-name | jq -r ".identity.credentials.token")

# Now use the token for further automation
echo "Token has been captured and can be used for authentication"
```

## Notes

- The bootstrap process can only be performed once on a fresh Infisical instance
- All flags are required for the bootstrap process to complete successfully
- Security controls prevent privilege escalation: instance admin identities cannot be managed by non-instance admin users and identities
- The generated admin user account can be used to log in via the UI if needed
